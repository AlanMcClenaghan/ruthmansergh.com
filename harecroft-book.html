        <h3>Harecroft Hall 1712-2017<br>(Work in progress)</h3>
        <p>This is the first book to be published about Harecroft Hall – JS Ainsworth’s mansion in 1881 – and Harecroft Hall School with the embarrassingly bright pink “HH” blazers, pink ties and much-respected and arguably much-loved Penrices.</p>
        <p>The school, whose old boys include Tam Dalyell and singer Tom Morley, was opened by Roy Vallance and Mary Farish Brown in 1926 as a preparatory school for boys destined to elite public schools.</p>
        <p>All boys were taught to ride by a resident riding mistress on ponies maintained on the premises.</p>
        <p>It went bankrupt, but was revived by Tom McClelland, as much marketing guy as headteacher.</p>
        <p>Children’s author Geoffrey Trease was a teacher at the school and wrote of his time there, and some boys had piano lessons from Eileen Joyce.</p>
        <p>Tom Penrice, who bought the business from William Dunlop, was headmaster from 1965 to 1992.
        <p>Sadly, Harecroft Hall School, which had strong links with St Bees School, closed in 2008.<p>
        <p>Interesting snippets include Sir John Hare, the Pack Horse inn, slave emancipation money, the Bolton connection, “the few who were left behind”, the extraordinary Major Brewin and elusive “Mary” Brewin, Harecroft as a bulwark of bacherlordom, Mr Howell’s tree top adventure, Mr Penrice’s goose rearing, pupils’ memories, and Mr Penrice’s famous black book that goes back to 1945.</p>
