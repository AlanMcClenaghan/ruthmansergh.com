        <h3>About Ruth Mansergh</h3>
        <p>I am a mother-of-two who has worked as a journalist and as a freelance sub-editor/proofreader for publications including <em>Financial Adviser</em> and the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p>
        <p>I was brought up in Cumbria, went to school in North Yorkshire and I have a degree in English with Social History from Leeds University and a fast-track NCTJ qualification.</p>
        <p>I have inherited my fatherâ€™s keen interest in local history.</p>
        <p>I also have a Land Registry/Law Society conveyancing qualification. I passed all six assignments and my work was described as beautifully written.</p>
        <p>Work from home, where I have access to InDesign and Photoshop, enables me to balance looking after my children with a part-time career. This also means I do not face barriers because of my disability.</p>
        <p>I currently live in north Surrey, within easy distance of the National Archives at Kew where I can carry out research.</p>
